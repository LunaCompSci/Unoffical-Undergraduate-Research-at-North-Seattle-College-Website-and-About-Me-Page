    <p>The undergraduate research program (UGR) is a class at NSC.</p>
    <p>
      You can take it one quarter but you'll be able to do more interesting stuff
      if you stay longer.
    </p>
    <p>It's typically mostly biology and chemistry students however</p>
    <p> engineering students are allowed to be there too</p>
    <p> Students with the best ideas will go to the undergraduate research sympoism at UW!</p>
    <p> It's a very team based class</p>

    <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
    <h3>Pros:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You get to partcipate in early research as an undergraduate.
        UW has students do it at the <em>end</em> of their senior year </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cons:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> If you've covered how to use the databases in an English class (ex. ENG102)
          then you know everything they've taught in the first quarter of online UGR </li>
        <li> You have to pay 3 credits worth </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Neither Pro or Con:</h3>
      <p>It's hard to understand other people's presentations outside your feild.
        It's true that in the real world science is interdisaplinary
        I think it's unrealistic for a biologist to speak with computer scientist
        for long periods of time. Especially in big companies where they have
        the budget to specialize. In smaller companies it be more likely.</p>

        <h2>The online vs in person experience.</h2>
        <p> Students don't get to go into labs. </p>
        <p>Warning the developer who made this site only stayed for 1 online quarter.</p>
